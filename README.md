## Overview of the school district analysis

For the purpose of this Challenge, we are tasked to provide support to Maria, a chief data scientist who works for a city school system. Previously, we supported Maria by preparing the schools’ standardized test score data to be used for future trend and pattern analysis. Upon further a review, we have been informed that the data shows evidence of academic dishonesty so we most modify our data to not include the school and grade in question as the scores impact the total results for the district. We have been asked to repeat the district analysis without including Thomas High School’s 9th graders test results.

## Results: 

### How is the district summary affected?
Thomas High School is the 2nd highest performing school in the district. After removing the 9th grade results of this school from our analysis, we can see that the overall district results decrease slightly; however, Thomas High School remains the 2nd highest performing school. Although the district reading scores drop slightly, we see that removing Thomas High School’s 9th grade results has a slightly greater impact on the math results which ultimately impacts the overall passing % as well.
